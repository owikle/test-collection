appreciate the magnitude of the service trees provide in a single community.
Oxygen production, CO2 absorption
Trees occupy considerable space and, along with large shrubs, are major components in any landscape. They serve many purposes like providing shade and beauty, but trees are more important than that. Trees are essential to life on earth, since they affect the very air we breathe by producing oxygen and absorbing and removing large amounts of carbon dioxide and other pollutant gases from the atmosphere. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), 1 acre of forest annually absorbs 6 tons of carbon dioxide and releases 4 tons of oxygen, enough to meet the annual oxygen needs of 18 adults.
Energy conservation
Trees contribute many economic benefits such as improving the value of real estate and reducing heating and cooling costs when strategically placed to provide shade or as windscreens around buildings. USDA researchers have established that the net cooling effect of one healthy tree is equivalent to 10 room-sized air conditioners operating 20 hours a day! Trees planted near scorching-hot parking lots can reduce temperatures under their canopies by as much as 12 degrees Fahrenheit. All of this cooling generates an overall energy savings for home and commercial building owners. The hidden benefit of this reduction in energy usage is reduced power plant emissions.
Recreation, relaxation
Woody plants are especially important for restoring the natural harmony that is often lost in urban settings. Landscapes with plenty of trees and shrubs draw in birds and other wildlife, providing them with homes and food. While we accept that trees connect us to the natural environment and improve our surroundings and quality of life, we sometimes forget that trees create the cool, protected sites we seek for recreation and relaxation. They provide pleasant, special places we like to visit such as forests and parks. Stress reduction is an important health benefit that is often forgotten when considering the value of trees.
TREE SELECTION
Use the table on pages 6 and 7 to help you select trees that are suitable for our arid environment. The watering rates in the table will help you make good decisions about watering the trees once they become established.
TREE WATERING
In southwestern Idaho, supplemental irrigation is essential in landscapes using non-native plants. Water is the single most important factor for tree survival and growth. All the metabolic processes that occur within a tree depend on water.
During the growing season, trees constantly lose water to the atmosphere through transpiration — the loss of water vapor through leaf pores (stomata). In the heat of summer, it has been estimated that a large deciduous tree can use more than 100 gallons of water a day! If this water loss is not replaced, it can cause non- recoverable tissue damage and lead to tree decline, making the tree susceptible to pests and diseases. The importance and value of trees in a landscape cannot be overemphasized. Tree health, therefore, should be at the forefront of any irrigation regime.
Nine irrigation tips for promoting tree health and water conservation
• Check soil moisture before watering.
• Irrigate in early morning rather than during the heat of the day.
• Avoid irrigating during windy weather unless you are using a drip system.
• Don’t rely on the timings used for turfgrass irrigation to water trees.
• Use drip irrigation and soaker hoses to deliver water to young trees and to flower and shrub beds.
• Irrigate newly planted trees weekly for up to three growing seasons, until they become well rooted.
• Irrigate established trees deeply (12–15 inches) but infrequently to help roots develop to a proper depth, thus promoting better drought tolerance.
• Discourage root and crown diseases by irrigating established trees and shrubs near the dripline and beyond.
• Use mulches on the soil surface to conserve moisture, control weeds, and maintain a uniform soil temperature. Keep mulch 2 inches away from tree and shrub stems to discourage root and crown diseases.
