Trees for southwestern Idaho landscapes: Selection and irrigation

The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The next best time is now. —Chinese Proverb
INTRODUCTION
Climatically, the valley regions of southwestern Idaho are classified as desert, with hot, dry summers and cold, relatively dry winters. Relative humidity is typically very low year-round, which creates high water use by plants, especially during summer months. Annual precipitation is in the range of 9 inches (Mountain Home) to 12 inches (Boise). In contrast, a traditional landscape that includes trees requires more than 40 inches of water during a growing season to remain green and healthy. Add to southwestern Idaho’s climate the fact that it stands face-to-face with limited water resources, and the challenge of maintaining a beautiful landscape in the future becomes quickly evident.
Even with sufficient irrigation water, the desert climates of southwestern Idaho are less than ideal for tree survival and health. The combination of hot summer temperature and low relative humidity produces conditions of constant stress, especially if the trees are marginally adapted. If water becomes less available in the future, with concurrent limitations on irrigation, many of the tree species commonly planted in the region will not live.
Ensuring adequate future water resources will require conservation and stewardship on the part of southwestern Idaho’s residents. Studies have shown that as much as 60% of the overall water used by homeowners is used outdoors, with the largest portion being applied to landscapes and lawns. Although very few tree species are truly xeric (needing no irrigation), some trees are naturally more water thrifty than others and can help a gardener reduce water usage in the landscape.
Selecting adapted, water-conserving plants, including trees, is the first step in becoming a good water steward. Next is learning how to irrigate trees and landscapes to conserve water while maintaining plant health. This publication provides guidance on choosing adapted tree species for the region and irrigating efficiently.

WHY PLANT TREES?
Water and soil conservation
Trees play a large role in water conservation as they intercept and store water. They stabilize soil with their extensive root systems, reducing soil erosion and runoff and thus improving water quality. Wooded areas conserve and naturally filter water, recharging the ground water supply and preventing the transport of sediments and chemicals into streams.
In Boise, the 23,000-plus publicly managed street trees intercept 19 million gallons of storm water annually, a service worth more than $96,000 to the city. Consider that same service being carried out by thousands of privately owned landscape trees throughout the city of Boise, and you can
