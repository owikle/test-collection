THE CURTIS HOTEL  
MINNEAPOLIS  

<div class="text-end">Oct 5, 1923</div>

To whom it may concern:-

My thoughts just before the first real college game of my life. The honor of my race, family, and self are at stake[.] Everyone is expecting me to do big things. I <u>will</u>! My whole body and soul are to be thrown recklessly about on the field tomorrow. Every time the ball is snapped I <u>will</u> be trying to do more than my part[.]

<div class="text-end" style="margin-right: 4em;">(supper)</div>

On all defensive plays I must break thru the opponets [<em>sic</em>] line at [<em>sic</em>] stop the play in their territory. Beware of mass interference <u>fight</u> low with your eyes open and toward the play. <u>Roll block the interference</u>[.] Watch out for cross bucks and reverse end runs. Be on your toes <u>every</u> minute if you expect to make good.
